# Project: Weather App

Very simple Weather App created as part of 'The Odin Project'. 

The app fetches weather data from an API and displays it. Any location's weather data can be searched. Only the present day's weather is displayed, no forecast.

For this project, I learnt about JSON, Asynchronous code, promises, async/await, fetch, and working with APIs.

This is a desktop-only website.
